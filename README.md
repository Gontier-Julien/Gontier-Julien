__My current project are:__

- The [Linux-YAOK Kernel](https://github.com/Gontier-Julien/Linux-YAOK) 🐧

  > ⚠️This project is now read-only and deprecated⚠️

  It the main kernel that i use for myself and on my servers *(even tho they have they're specific configs and versions)*.  
  I mainly maintain this Kernel because i wanted an **optimized kernel**, but that didn't compromise on stabilty.  
  It based on the latest **Linux Longterm branch** to prevent instability due to new stuff added in the Kernel.

<br/>

- The [Docker DOH image](https://github.com/Gontier-Julien/docker-dns-over-https) 📦

  > ⚠️This project is now read-only and deprecated⚠️

  A DOH server in a super tiny docker image using distroless or scratch to run (>8.5MB!) 🚀

<br/>

- The [Twemoji-Remastered](https://github.com/Gontier-Julien/Twemoji-Remastered)  magisk modules 🐦

  I really ❤️️ the [Twitter emoji](https://emojis.wiki/twitter/) 🐦, so that why i decided to continue maintain 🔧 the module _Twemoji_.  
  Why Remastered you may ask? Well because it again here and Remastered sound cool 😎
